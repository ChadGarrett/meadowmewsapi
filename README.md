# MeadowMewsAPI

API for the dashboard that I use to help manage my home life.

## Features

### Current:
1. Tracking of monthly levy statements
2. Tracking of monthly water statements
3. Tracking of prepaid electricity purchases

### Planned:

- Statistic endpoints showing summaries, totals and averages of the tracked statements for a graph page.
- Turn the API into an entire estate management tool, by allowing multiple households to be added under one estate.
